# techdegree-project
my 1st techdegree project


The code is asking for the users input to pick a number 1-10, creating an empty list for the number to go into, and setting the random number generator range to 1-10
Once the user has entered a number the code will enter a while loop command to display whether or not the number the user entered is higher or lower than the generated one.
Once the player gets the number right the system will then tell the player that they got it right, the number of tries it took them, and will notify them that they have finished the game.

It will then prompt them if they want to play the game again or not.
If they choose yes, it will restart the game
If they choose no, it will end the game
